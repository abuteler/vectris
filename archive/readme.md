#Welcome to the Archive!

To stop Github's indexing engine from misrepresentating the actual composition of programming languages used in the most recent version of this game, I've decided to keep all previous versions of the game in compressed tar files.

In case you would for any reason like to revisit these archived versions of the game, and you're operating on a Linux machine you can just run `tar -xvf filename.tar.gz` in the command line, replacing `filename` with the version you want to extract.
